## Where Do We Post Content?

- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/techlore) YouTube is the platform we started on and will continue to publish to. We are firm believers in targeting the masses who are using non-private platforms like YouTube. 
- [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@techlore:3) Odysee is a federated and (slightly more) privacy-respecting YouTube alternative for users who don't want to engage with our content through YouTube.
- [PeerTube](https://bitcointv.com/c/techlore/videos) Similar to Odysee, PeerTube is another method of watching our content in a freedom-respecting way.
